# Global rules

- Do not add comments to code unless strictly necessary, strip added comments if accidentally added
- Write clear and concise idiomatic code
- Do not add any new dependencies
- Use TDD and table tests whenever possible, use surrounding test files for common patterns
- The project compiles w/ `make`, run that to ensure the project compiles
- To lint the go code, run `make lint`
